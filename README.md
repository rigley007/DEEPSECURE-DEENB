## Overview
**DEEPSECURE-DEENB** is a Python-based framework designed to generate adversarial examples, analyze their effects on deep learning models, and potentially evaluate model vulnerabilities. It leverages modular and customizable components such as generators, feature extractors, and data loaders to create and train adversarial scenarios. 


## Key Features
- **Adversarial Image Generation**: Create adversarial examples using various generation techniques.
- **Pre-trained Model Extraction**: Utilize pre-trained models for feature extraction.
- **Custom Data Loading**: Load and preprocess datasets, such as ImageNet10, for training and evaluation.
